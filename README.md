# Predrinks-the-video-game
Predrinks is a light-hearted single-player game featuring narrative aspects and decision-based gameplay. In a fun pre-gaming scenario, players are presented with multiple options. The final objective is to show up to the club totally "in the zone" for an exciting evening of fun. These decisions have an impact on the character's level of drunkenness.  

Predrinks provides a subtle layer of problem-solving. To control their level of inebriation under a time constraint, players must make intelligent decisions with the options of food, drink, and water. This is the time before leaving to go to the nightclub. It takes careful planning and a balance between excess and moderation to reach the right level of inebriation before a fun night ahead.
